Writing Interpreters
--------------------

To implement the semantics of some programming language, an interpreter
will consist of at least a few componenets:
```
.---------.    .--------.     .-------------.    .-------------.
|  lexer  | -> | parser | -> | type checker | -> | interpreter |
'---------'    '--------'    '--------------'    '-------------'
 lexer.mll      parser.mly     typecheck.ml       interpreter.ml
                parser.mli
                ast.mli
```

This blog post is basically a write of of my work on assignment two of
Stanford's CS242 class, where we'll explore the process of writing an
interpreter for the _simply typed lambda calculus_.

## The Simply Typed Lambda Calculus


## Lexing
OCaml has a run-time library for lexers generated by `ocamllex` that's used in this
project to generate a lexer by giving names to a few regular expressions:

```ocaml
rule token = parse
| "(*" _* "*)" { token lexbuf }
| [' ' '\t' '\n'] { token lexbuf }
| '.' { DOT }
| '(' { LPAREN }
| ')' { RPAREN }
| "fn" { FN }
| "int" { TY_INT }
| "->" { ARROW }
| "=>" { FATARROW }
|       ...
| ['0'-'9']+ as i { INT (int_of_string i) }
| '-'['0'-'9']+ as i { INT (int_of_string i) }
| eof { EOF }
| _ { raise (Error (Printf.sprintf "At offset %d: unexpected character.\n" (Lexing.lexeme_start lexbuf))) }

```

Where our _entry point_ is named "token" and basically becomes an OCaml function that
takes one argument (since we didn't give it any arguments of our own, there is still
the implicit last argument of type `Lexing.lexbug`, where characters are read from).
We then pass this new lexical analyzer function as an argument to the parser...

## Parsing
Alongside OCaml's very nice lexer library, the standard library also provides the
command-line tool `ocamlyacc` that generates a parse from some specification of a
context-free grammar with attached semantic actions. The grammar used by our OCaml
`yacc` variant lives in `parser.mly`.
