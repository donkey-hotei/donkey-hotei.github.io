this post we'll walk though the code that makes up the GPIO driver in subphase C of\nassignment one of Stanford's cs140e course, where we see hardware peripherals modeled as a\nkind of finite state machine, with the type system being used to enforce certain static guarantees\nthat our code itself doesn't cause the hardware to go into some nonsensical or \"invalid state\".\nThis is a combination exploration of type systems and their use when developing drivers for the\nperipherals of embedded devices.\nTo get there we should explore each of the ideas that help us understand what this all means from the beginning\nand then zoom into our final goal.\nTypes\nLike many concepts in computer programming, \"types\" are an older mathematical concept that\nfinds it's existence reified in the type systems of modern day programming languages.\nIn a nutshell, the word \"type\" has similar meaning to when one says \"this type of thing or another\",\ndenoting that two, maybe similar, things have different properties. For our case these  types are given\nto the terms in the language we are writing in.\nIn the language of arithmetic we can say 41 + 1, or 42, or 21 * 2 are all valid terms\nwith their type as natural numbers, abbreviated as nat - maybe written with a colon to denote\nthe type like 42: nat1. Whereas\na term like 1 / 2 is an invalid expression for nat types but a valid rational number, which\nis another type.\nFor a natural language, like English, we have terms with types whose composition in a sentence is defined\nby the English grammar. We can say that cold is of the adjective type and beer is of the noun\ntype with our grammar saying we must put adjectives before the nouns, so \"cold beer\" is\na valid expression while \"beer cold\" is a \"nonsensical\".\nThe mathematical notion of the \"type\" grew out of some apparent inconsistencies in the foundations\nof mathematics. Bertrand Russel wrote of the \"theories of type\" back in 1902 as a way to remediate a version of\nnaive set theory that was afflicted with Russel's paradox. The details of all this are beyond\nthe scope of this article, but we'll address the more common usage of what we mean by a \"type theory\" when we\nexplore Alonzo Church's simply typed lambda calculus in another post. This is another great resource\nfor you type-freaks out there.\nWhat's interesting is that the theory of types as created by Russel was a new logical language different from set theory\nwhere concepts like \"and\" and \"or\" and \"maybe\", found in the predicate logic set theory was\nbuilt upon, can be encoded into the types of the type system itself. See the wikipedia post on\ntype theory for how concepts in set theory find their counterpart in the theory of types.\nIt should suffice to say that when we are giving a type to a term, variable, or object we are determining\nthe set of things we can do to that object and that a language with a type system can check statements\nin the language for their type correctness to enforce that operations applied to operands are of the correct type.\nThis is a powerful concept that helps us create large systems that are easier to reason about, in which the programs\nwhen compiled and type checked are themselves sort of proofs of their correctness.\nCool. So, what are some sorts of things that can be encoded in a type system?\nType States\nThere are many things we can encode into a type system, here we're going to jump beyond numbers, pairs, booleans,\nalgebraic types, and the like, and instead talk about something a little more arcane: type states.\nSo, what exactly is a  type state? If you've ever studied a couple of nice finite state machines then the concept is\njust that: types states are a way for us encode finite state automata into a type system. They are, as\nyou might think, the idea that we can ascribe a given set of states to some type. Where we say that some object with some type\nis always in one of the type states\nassociated with that type. To move from one type state to another we perform some operation thats allowable on that\ntype in the given type state that it's in. These operations2 when done one after the\nother effectively act a series of state transitions (coercions) between (type)states and thus form a kind of finite state machine,\nallowing us to keep track of the state that some statefully typed object is in.\nIn brief, type states also allow us to keep track of the order in which certain operations are made on an object.\nTo illustrate why this is a useful idea, let's make this more concrete with a practical example borrowed from David Teller's\narticle on type states in Rust:\nSay we have a File type, with three states: \"initialized\", \"opened\" and \"closed\". The state machine could be drawn something like:\n        .---------------. open  .--------. close  .--------.\n        |  initialized  | ----&gt; | opened | -----&gt; | closed |\n        '---------------'       '--------'        '--------'\n                                  ^    |\n                                  `----'\n                                 seek/read\n\nA File can't be read unless it has been opened, we also can't seek to a part of the\nfile unless it is open, nor can we close an unopened file. Though, once the file is\nopen we can do those things, and then close when finished. Here's the Rust code:\nfn read_file(path: &amp;Path) -&gt; String {\n    let mut file = File::new(path);\n    // opening the file _could_ fail\n    file.open();\n    // invalid read() if file failed to open\n    let data = file.read();\n    file.close();\n    file.seek(Seek::Start); // ERROR! Already closed.\n\n    data\n}\nTyped move semantics\nHow can we ensure that this kind of behavior is caught by the Rust compiler? Luckily for us\nwe can exploit Rust's affline type system to leverage the use of it's special move semantics.\nIf you haven't already read the Book, at least as much of it s.t. you understand\nthe basic ideas behind ownership and borrowing, that's always a good thing\nto do but, it's not totally necessary here minus some syntax.\nHere's the implementation of our File:\nstruct File { path: Path, cursor: usize, is_open: bool }\n\nimpl File {\n    pub fn new(path: &amp;Path) { File { path, cursor: 0, is_open: false } }\n\n    // NOTE: Here we're using the venerable `Result` type which gives the postfix \"?\" operator\n    //       that allows us to propagate errors if, say, any operations on the file fail.\n    pub fn open(path: &amp;Path) -&gt; Result&lt;File, Error&gt; {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // NOTE: Here `self` is \"moved\" into `close()`, by being passed by value and not\n    //       by reference, consuming the file and effectively making any operations\n    //       on `self` after this call to `close()` invalid.\n    pub fn close(self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // NOTE: &amp;mut self, is a mutable reference and doesn't actually consume the file,\n    //       making operations on self after reading, valid.\n    pub fn read(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;String, Error&gt; {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    pub fn seek(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt; {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nAs you can see, depending on how we use references and Rust's move semantics by passing self,\n&amp;self, or &amp;mut self to the various File operations we are trivially informing the Rust compiler,\nthrough the borrow checker, of a File's type states and how they should be enforced at compile-time.\nLet's go about implementing Drop for our File before re-evaluating the type checker's reaction to read_file():\nimpl Drop for File {\n    // NOTE: The Drop trait is basically like a \"destructor\" that can be used to\n    //       automatically close the file when it falls out of scope.\n    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.close()\n    }\n}\n\nNow here's the expected behavior we'd like to see from compiler, totally eliminating the\npossiblity of read()'ing a file that hasn't been opened or seek()'ing a file that has\nalready been closed:\nfn read_file(path: &amp;Path) -&gt; String {\n    let mut file = File::new(path);\n    // opening the file _could_ fail, so we now use \"?\" to catch the exception.\n    file.open()?;\n    // if opening the file failed, then we never reach this line.\n    let data = file.read()?;\n\n    {\n        let mut scoped_file = File::new(path);\n        file.open()?;\n        file.read()?; // valid if no runtime error, still open\n    } // scoped_file falls out of scope, but is Drop so closes\n\n    file.close(); // valid, as file's in the \"open\" state.\n\n    // ERROR! Now statically caught by the compiler.\n    file.seek(Seek::Start);\n\n    data\n}\n\nThe error we'd see when seek()'ing the file would look something like:\nr[E0382]: use of moved value: `file`\n --&gt; src/main.rs:9:14\n     |\n   8 |     file.close();\n     |          - value moved here\n   9 |     file.seek(Seek::Start);\n     |        ^ value used here after move\n     |\n     = note: move occurs because `file` has type `File`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\n\nThis is Rust's ownership-centric view of the world at work. Since File is a type\nthat doesn't implement Copy it is an affline type where:\n\nAffine types are a version of linear types allowing to discard (i.e. not use) a resource, corresponding to affine logic. An affine resource can only be used once, while a linear one must be used once.\n\nAnd thus, by passing the File resource by value, we have effectively moved it, or transferred ownership of that resource\nto the close() method. As a perhaps trivial way of using this unique and pragmatic type system to enforce type states,\nit's possible to ensure that no File is ever acted on after it's been closed.\nThough, let's note, that we've encoded the type system implicitly in Rust's move semantics for a simple example that was amenable to that.\nCan we be more explicit that what we're dealing with are type states?\nWe can. Let's finally move into a more complex example, which calls for something a little more than typed moves and\noffers a more real-life example where one would not want to live without type states which\ninvolves our beloved little hardware target: the Raspberry Pi.\nBCM2835 ARM Peripherals\nBefore diving back into Rust-world we'll try to cultivate some basic way of thinking about hardware as a state machine as well as\ngo into some details on the GPIO subsystem of the BCM2835 ARM processor seen on the Raspberry Pi 3.\nThe \"General Purpose Input Output\" subsystem of the Raspberry Pi is documented on page 89 (section 6) of the\nBCM2837 ARM Peripherals Manual. These are the external pins that folks usually use to interface with\nother computers and electronic gizmos.\nThe vertical pin layout of the GPIO pins, courtesy of tvierb :\n                                J8\n                               .___.\n                      +3V3---1-|O O|--2--+5V\n              (SDA)  GPIO2---3-|O O|--4--+5V\n             (SCL1)  GPIO3---5-|O O|--6--_\n        (GPIO_GLCK)  GPIO4---7-|O O|--8-----GPIO14 (TXD0)\n                          _--9-|O.O|-10-----GPIO15 (RXD0)\n        (GPIO_GEN0) GPIO17--11-|O O|-12-----GPIO18 (GPIO_GEN1)\n        (GPIO_GEN2) GPIO27--13-|O O|-14--_\n        (GPIO_GEN3) GPIO22--15-|O O|-16-----GPIO23 (GPIO_GEN4)\n                      +3V3--17-|O O|-18-----GPIO24 (GPIO_GEN5)\n         (SPI_MOSI) GPIO10--19-|O.O|-20--_\n         (SPI_MOSO) GPIO9 --21-|O O|-22-----GPIO25 (GPIO_GEN6)\n         (SPI_SCLK) GPIO11--23-|O O|-24-----GPIO8  (SPI_C0_N)\n                          _-25-|O O|-26-----GPIO7  (SPI_C1_N)\n           (EEPROM) ID_SD---27-|O O|-28-----ID_SC Reserved for ID EEPROM\n                    GPIO5---29-|O.O|-30--_\n                    GPIO6---31-|O O|-32-----GPIO12\n                    GPIO13--33-|O O|-34--_\n                    GPIO19--35-|O O|-36-----GPIO16\n                    GPIO26--37-|O O|-38-----GPIO20\n                          _-39-|O O|-40-----GPIO21\n                               '---'\n                           40W 0.1\" PIN HDR\n\nAs mentioned in the manual, there are 54 pins total split into two banks. It's said that each of these pins\nhave at least two \"alternative functions\", which, in plain English, is really just a way of saying \"each of these pins can act\nas an input or an output, but some can do other things like UART, SPI, &amp;c\".\nYou can see which pins above likely support some of the other special alternative functions in the pinout above.\nTo select a pin we'd like to use, and it's function, we look at a the right FSEL (function select)\nregister for our pin and flip the right bits. The layout of an FSEL register looks like this:\npin #:        9   9   9   8   8   8         0   0   0\n            .___.___.___.___.___.___.____ .___.___.___.\n            | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n            '---'---'---'---'---'---'-----'---'---'---'\n\nWith three bits being dedicated to each pin, allowing allows at most 10 pins per GPFSELn register (32-bits total)\nwith at least two left unused.\nWith the three bits associated to our pin found, we set the function of this pin by using the corresponding bit\npattern. As per the manual we have:\n\n000 for output\n001 for input`\n100 for alternate function zero\n101 for alternate function one\nso and and so forth like, 110, 111, 011, or 010 for the rest up to alt. function 5.\n\nTo set and clear pins (on or off) that have been set as outputs  we check out the SET and CLR registers (two of each to\ncover every pin) and flip the corresponding bit (1st pin has 1st rightmost bit in the first\nregister, the 33rd pin as the 1st rightmost bit in the second register).\nTo check the level of a pin that's been set as an input we check the LVL register to check if the voltage on that\npin is low or high.\nNow the state machine is begining to float out of the screen... Output pins can be set and cleared and input pins\ncan only be used to read the voltage level at that pin. We wouldn't want to break the specification by reading the\nlevels of an output pin, or attempting to set and clear a pin the ARM thinks is an input, would we? We'd like to be able to write\nour driver with these concerns out of the way, and to allow others to use the public API of our driver to play with the\nPi's GPIO at a low-level without worry that they may be about to run software that puts the hardware into an invalid state.\nAll of the code we'll see here lives in my solution repo for the course. Let's break it down piece-by-piece and take a\ndeep-dive into Rust and driver internals:\nGPIO Driver Implementation\nTop-level imports\nuse common::{IO_BASE, states};\nuse volatile::prelude::*;\nuse volatile::{Volatile, WriteVolatile, ReadVolatile, Reserved};\n\nHardware devices communicate with software through memory-mapped I/O where their functionality\nis revealed through a certain set of memory addresses. The data-sheet we were reading above gives\nus a specification for what will happen to the device when we read or write to certain addresses\nin memory. IO_BASE gives us the base, or start, address of where the Pi's I/O peripherals are\nmapped to. The GPIO registers exist at an offset from that base addresss.\nVolatile, WriteVolatile, ReadVolatile, and Reserved are all pointer types that we'll go into\nthe details of in another post that will be about exposing unsafe code safely in Rust. Suffice to say, these are pointer\ntypes that come with certain static guarantees about what you can and cannot do to the pointer-type (address) that it wraps (points-to).\nFor example, the compiler will complain if you try to apply a bit-mask to a ReadVolatile pointer since it's\na read-only pointer and doesn't have any operations on it that allow writes.\nFunctions and Registers\nHere we encode the available functions into Rust's tagged-union type: the enum.\n/// An alternative GPIO function.\n#[repr(u8)]\npub enum Function {\n    Input  = 0b000,\n    Output = 0b001,\n    Alt0   = 0b100,\n    Alt1   = 0b101,\n    Alt2   = 0b110,\n    Alt3   = 0b111,\n    Alt4   = 0b011,\n    Alt5   = 0b010\n}\n\nNow we can use the various Functions like Function::Input or Function::Output as, for example arguments to\nfunctions that take the Function type as an argument, and bit patterns will be substitued in. Nice start!\nrepr is a macro described in the nomicon that affects the data layout, or alignment,\nof the type we're defining. Here, with repr(u8), we're saying, \"any variant of Function must be aligned to 8 bits\"\n(i.e: each variant lives 8-bits apart from the next). There are many other reprs and the one's being\nused here come from RFC2195 on the feature called \"Really Tagged Unions\". This is cool because enums aren't a\nconcept in C, yet we can still leverage high-level programming with a strongly typed language on bare metal...\nNext we write out the relevant GPIO registers and type their pointers with the access-controlled\npointer types we got from the volatile crate, as per the spec:\n#[repr(C)]\n#[allow(non_snake_case)]\nstruct Registers {\n    FSEL: [Volatile&lt;u32&gt;; 6],      // function select register\n    __r0: Reserved&lt;u32&gt;,\n    SET: [WriteVolatile&lt;u32&gt;; 2],  // set register\n    __r1: Reserved&lt;u32&gt;,\n    CLR: [WriteVolatile&lt;u32&gt;; 2],  // clear register\n    __r2: Reserved&lt;u32&gt;,\n    LEV: [ReadVolatile&lt;u32&gt;; 2],   // level register\n    __r3: Reserved&lt;u32&gt;,\n    EDS: [Volatile&lt;u32&gt;; 2],\n    __r4: Reserved&lt;u32&gt;,\n    REN: [Volatile&lt;u32&gt;; 2],\n    __r5: Reserved&lt;u32&gt;,\n    FEN: [Volatile&lt;u32&gt;; 2],\n    __r6: Reserved&lt;u32&gt;,\n    HEN: [Volatile&lt;u32&gt;; 2],\n    __r7: Reserved&lt;u32&gt;,\n    LEN: [Volatile&lt;u32&gt;; 2],\n    __r8: Reserved&lt;u32&gt;,\n    AREN: [Volatile&lt;u32&gt;; 2],\n    __r9: Reserved&lt;u32&gt;,\n    AFEN: [Volatile&lt;u32&gt;; 2],\n    __r10: Reserved&lt;u32&gt;,\n    PUD: Volatile&lt;u32&gt;,\n    PUDCLK: [Volatile&lt;u32&gt;; 2],\n}\n\nrepr(C) tells Rust compiler to do what C does - the layout seen will be exactly as you'd\nexpect in C(++) with each field stored right-after-the-other and not optimized all over the place.\nallow(non_snake_case) disables the snake-case lint on field-members so we can use all capitol letters to\nname our registers - feels appropriate.\nThe layout of the registers is just as is described in the manual. The syntax [Volatile&lt;u32&gt;; 6]\nsays, \"here lives six 32-bit pointers that we expect to be able to read and write to\".\nStateful GPIO\nSo, far we know that a pin can be either an input or an output or one of the alt functions.\nOkay so that means when a pin is in one of these states it can only do certain things. In what order\ncan change the state of a pin, and what can we do at each state? Let's draw out the simple-transition\ndiagram of our upcoming Gpio type.\n                                              .~-----.\n    .---------------.  Function::Input   .---------. | level\n    | uninitialized |------------------&gt; |  Input  |&lt;'\n    '---------------'                    `---------'\n      |       |   Function::Output    .---------.\n      |        `--------------------&gt; |  Output | -.\n      |   Function::Alt  .-----.      `---------'  |  set/clear\n       `---------------&gt; | Alt |             ^.____/\n                         `-----'\n\nIt would be pretty difficult to encode this state machine using a series of typed moves only,\nwe need this and something more. Here is our Gpio type, as of now, plain and simple:\npub struct Gpio {\n    pin: u8,\n    registers: &amp;'static mut Registers,\n}\n\nWe have a byte-size pin field and mutable reference to the GPIO Registers type that has a static\nlifetime. This is to say that this mutable reference lives for entire life time of the program.\nIn Rust we can parameterize container types with the other generic types it contains. For example,\nVec&lt;T&gt; is a vector-type in rust that takes some generic type T so it could be concretized as\neither Vec&lt;u8&gt;, for a vector of u8's or as Vec&lt;Vec&lt;char&gt;&gt; as a vector of vectors of chars.\nWhat if we could parameterize the Gpio type with its associated state? Just as marker, not be\nused. Like so,\npub struct Gpio&lt;State&gt; {\n    pin: u8,\n    registers: &amp;'static mut Registers,\n}\n\nWhen running this definition through the Rust compiler, we'd receive the error:\nerror[E0392]: parameter `State` is never used\n--&gt; src/lib.rs:1:17\n  |\n1 | pub struct Gpio&lt;State&gt; {\n  |                 ^^^^^ unused type parameter\n  |\n  = help: consider removing `State` or using a marker such as `std::marker::PhantomData`\n\nAh, interesting! So, we really do have to use the type parameter and the compiler will\nalways complain if we paramterize something on a type and don't make use of it. Nice, but\nwe still want to mark or Gpio pin with it's state and... and what's this... PhantomData!?\nPhantomData of the opera\nMany of those who lived a life programming in strongly-typed functional languages will be\nfamiliar with the concept of phantom data types. The word \"phantom\" seems to imply something\nthat is seen but doesn't actually exists. In fact, this is exactly the kind of phantom types do for\nour type system. It's a parameterized \"marker\" type that isn't actually used, so we can use it\nto inform the type system so that we can parameterize our own types and not use the types their\nparameterized on for anything other than as a marker. Very cool.\nOur new definition of the Gpio type as it's parameterized on State:\n/// A GPIO pin in state `State`.\n///\n/// The `State` generic always corresponds to an uninstantiatable type that is\n/// use solely to mark and track the state of a given GPIO pin. A `Gpio`\n/// structure starts in the `Uninitialized` state and must be transitioned into\n/// one of `Input`, `Output`, or `Alt` via the `into_input`, `into_output`, and\n/// `into_alt` methods before it can be used.\npub struct Gpio&lt;State&gt; {\n    pin: u8,\n    registers: &amp;'static mut Registers,\n    _state: PhantomData&lt;State&gt;\n}\n\nOkay - let's write our states. Since we plan for these to just be markers, we'll never\ninstantiate them. Sounds like a use case for a fieldless enum with no variants like:\npub enum Uninitialized { };\npub enum Input { };\npub enum Output { };\nput enum Alt { };\n\nOr, with a macro in place to generate our enums for us:\n/// Generates `pub enums` with no variants for each `ident` passed in.\npub macro states($($name:ident),*) {\n    $(pub enum $name {  })*\n}\n\nWe can define our states cleanly like:\n/// Possible states for a GPIO pin.\nstates! {\n    Uninitialized, Input, Output, Alt\n}\n\nAnd the methods that correspond to each state:\nimpl Gpio&lt;Output&gt; {\n    /// Sets (turns on) the pin.\n    pub fn set(&amp;mut self) {\n        // two banks, anything below pin 32 is in the first bank (either 0 or 1).\n        let index = (self.pin / 32) as usize;\n        // if in the first bank then pin 0 is in bit 0, if in bank two then\n        // 32nd bit is at bit 0, and (32 - 32 == 0).\n        let shift = self.pin as usize - index * 32;\n\n        self.registers\n            .SET[index]\n            .write(1 &lt;&lt; shift);\n    }\n\n    /// Clears (turns off) the pin.\n    pub fn clear(&amp;mut self) {\n        let index = (self.pin / 32) as usize;\n        let shift = self.pin as usize - index * 32;\n\n        self.registers\n            .CLR[index]\n            .write(1 &lt;&lt; shift);\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Gpio&lt;Input&gt; {\n    /// Reads the pin's value. Returns `true` if the level is high and `false`\n    /// if the level is low.\n    pub fn level(&amp;mut self) -&gt; bool {\n        let index = (self.pin / 32) as usize;\n        let shift = self.pin as usize - index * 32;\n\n        self.registers\n            .LEV[index]\n            .has_mask(1 &lt;&lt; shift)\n    }\n}\n\nThe code above follow from our discussion about what registers do what and the pins they\ncorrespond to. The comments should clarify the arithmetic needed to select the correct bit(s)\nfor a given pin.\nAnd then, boom - we suddenly have a way of tagging Gpio typed objects with the state they're\ncurrently in by wrapping the type we're parameterizing on with the phantom data type.\nThis is how we'll keep track of states, but how will we define our state-transitions?\nLike before, we can use typed moves to define transitions between states. We know how to do that.\nimpl Gpio&lt;Uninitialized&gt; {\n    fn transition(self) -&gt; Gpio&lt;Output&gt; {\n        Gpio {\n            pin: self.pin,\n            registers: self.registers,\n            _state: PhantomData\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nself, not being a reference, is moved into transition() and out comes a new output pin of type\nGpio&lt;Output&gt; with the old self dropped.\nHowever, transitions can exists on any one of the states (types) the Gpio type itself is\nparmaterized on and we should have a way of generically describing a transition so that we\ndon't have to enumerate each and every state a given state has transitions to. To be able to\nsay something like, \"Transition GPIO pin 42 from state T to some state S\".\nLet's use these generic type parameters in place of Uninitialized and Output:\nimpl&lt;T&gt; Gpio&lt;T&gt; {\n    /// Transitions `self` to state `S`, consuming `self` and returning a new\n    /// `Gpio` instance in state `S`. This method should _never_ be exposed to\n    /// the public!\n    #[inline(always)]\n    fn transition&lt;S&gt;(self) -&gt; Gpio&lt;S&gt; {\n        Gpio {\n            pin: self.pin,\n            registers: self.registers,\n            _state: PhantomData\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis is the only method on Gpio-typed objects we should hide from the user of our driver\ncompeltely because it is generic on the states it can transition to and from, working for\nall S and T. As implementors of this stateful Gpio type, we must use transition() carefully\nto spec otherwise the driver itself will be incorrect and will have none of the guarantees\nthe user of our driver would expect.\nTo transition we'll tell the Rust compiler what type to expect, or at least enough information\nso that it can infer:\n/// Sets this pin to be an _output_ pin. Consumes self and returns a `Gpio`\n/// structure in the `Output` state.\npub fn into_output(self) -&gt; Gpio&lt;Output&gt; {\n    self.into_alt(Function::Output).transition()\n}\n\n/// Sets this pin to be an _input_ pin. Consumes self and returns a `Gpio`\n/// structure in the `Input` state.\npub fn into_input(self) -&gt; Gpio&lt;Input&gt; {\n    self.into_alt(Function::Input).transition()\n}\n\nWhere into_alt is a function on Gpio&lt;Uninitialized&gt; that enables an alternative function for\na self (pin), by OR-masking the three bits associated with that pin with the bit pattern\nthat corresponds to the Function type variant we're using:\n/// Enables the alternative function `function` for `self`. Consumes self\n/// and returns a `Gpio` structure in the `Alt` state.\npub fn into_alt(self, function: Function) -&gt; Gpio&lt;Alt&gt; {\n    let fsel_index = self.pin as usize / 10;\n    // 10 pins per GPFSELn register, 3-bits per FSEL{n} field (i.e: per pin)\n    let pin_offset = (self.pin as usize % 10) * 3;\n\n    // clear function bits for pin\n    self.registers.FSEL[fsel_index]\n        .and_mask(!(0b111 &lt;&lt; pin_offset));\n\n    // write new function bits\n    self.registers.FSEL[fsel_index]\n        .or_mask((function as u32) &lt;&lt; pin_offset);\n\n    self.transition()\n}\n\nRust will infer, for example,  when calling transition() within .into_output() on a pin that\nthe T type is a Gpio&lt;Alt&gt; being transformed into a S which is a Gpio&lt;Output&gt;.\nFor completion here's the full Gpio&lt;Uninitialized&gt; implementation:\nimpl Gpio&lt;Uninitialized&gt; {\n    /// Returns a new `GPIO` structure for pin number `pin`.\n    ///\n    /// # Panics\n    ///\n    /// Panics if `pin` &gt; `53`.\n    pub fn new(pin: u8) -&gt; Gpio&lt;Uninitialized&gt; {\n        if pin &gt; 53 {\n            panic!(\"Gpio::new(): pin {} exceeds maximum of 53\", pin);\n        }\n\n        Gpio {\n            registers: unsafe { &amp;mut *(GPIO_BASE as *mut Registers) },\n            pin: pin,\n            _state: PhantomData\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn into_alt(self, function: Function) -&gt; Gpio&lt;Alt&gt; { ... }\n\n    pub fn into_output(self) -&gt; Gpio&lt;Output&gt; { ... }\n\n    pub fn into_input(self) -&gt; Gpio&lt;Input&gt; { ... }\n}\n\nThe type Gpio&lt;Uninitialized&gt; is the only state that has a new method so saying Gpio::new(42)\nwill create an uninitialized pin of type Gpio&lt;Uninitialized&gt; and the user can't fabricate an\ninvalid initial state and accidentally violate the hardware specification.\nConclusion\nWow, with a combination of phantom data types and typed moves we are able to create type states for\nour types! Rust is unique in allowing us to do this, though we should expect many languages down the\nroad to use some inspration from Rust's type system to allow programmers to encode perfectly the semantics\nof a type state in their programs. With this, we can create a world with more secure hardware drivers.\nJust Beautiful.\nShout outs\nThanks to those who wrote the Rust embedded book on peripherals as FSMs, hoverbear's\n\"Pretty State Machine Patterns in Rust\" post, to mozilla\nresearcher Dale Teller and their article on this subject, to the instructors who build\nthis class which introduced me to many interesting subjects, and of course to the original\npaper on the typestate by Robert E.

Affline type systems have never been so fascinating!\nAlso, at the Chaos Communications Congress this year was a great talk by Paul Emmerich, Simon Ellmann and Sebastian Voit\non writing safe and secure drivers in high-level languages with Rust as a primary example. Here's the link.\n1\nExample adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory\n\n2\nFrom wikipedia, \"For each two type states t1 &lt; t2, a unique typestate coercion operation\nneeds to be provided which, when applied to a typestate t2, reduces it to a typestate of t1...\"\n\n","id":"http://mysterious.computer/gpio-driver-in-rust/","title":"hardware peripherals and typestate analysis"},"http://mysterious.computer/lfsr-stream-cipher-csaw/":{"body":"","id":"http://mysterious.computer/lfsr-stream-cipher-csaw/","title":"csaw finals write-up: a non-binary LFSR stream cipher"},"http://mysterious.computer/memory-allocators-in-rust/":{"body":"Welcome to a cs140e blog post series, where I write down my notes as I work\nthrough Stanford's experimental course on operating systems in Rust. Today, we're going\nto walk through creating a dynamic memory allocator in Rust so that the kernel can use data structures\nthat live in the heap like the Vec and HashSet types. Think malloc and free: Rust-style.\nHere are the signatures for malloc and free in C:\nvoid * malloc(size_t size);\nvoid free(void * pointer);\n\nAnd the related signatures of alloc and dealloc in Rust (GlobalAlloc):\nunsafe fn alloc(&amp;self, _layout: Layout) -&gt; *mut u8;\nunsafe fn dealloc(&amp;self, _ptr: *mut u8, _layout: Layout);\n\nLater, we'll dive deeper into these type signatures.\nBefore writing a heap allocator, \"What is the heap?\".\nThe Book has a very good description of the characteristics of the heap and the stack\nin the ownership chapter. In summary, we can say the heap is where we put objects that are\npotentially variable and large in size and the stack consists of those objects whose size is typically\nsmaller and known at runtime. Since many collection types like HashMap and Vec can\nchange size during runtime, only by having a something to allocate them dynamically can\nwe unlock their powers.\n\nThe details will vary from system to system, but on the Raspberry Pi the heap will live\ndirectly after the kernel's binary in RAM. We assume that it's an area of demand-zero1\nmemory that begins after the uninitialized .bss2 area and moves upwards (towards higher\naddresses).\nMemory Alignment\n/// Align `addr` downwards to the nearest multiple of `align`.\n///\n/// The returned usize is always &lt;= `addr.`\n///\n/// # Panics\n///\n/// Panics if `align` is not a power of 2.\npub fn align_down(addr: usize, align: usize) -&gt; usize {\n    assert!(align.is_power_of_two());\n\n    (addr / align) * align\n}\n\n/// Align `addr` upwards to the nearest multiple of `align`.\n///\n/// The returned `usize` is always &gt;= `addr.`\n///\n/// # Panics\n///\n/// Panics if `align` is not a power of 2.\npub fn align_up(addr: usize, align: usize) -&gt; usize {\n    align_down(addr + align - 1, align)\n}\n\nThe Layout type describes the particular layout of a block of memory. This type has two\ngetter methods layout.size() and layout.align() that return the requested size of our\nblock and the alignment of that memory block's address.\nGlobalAlloc is an unsafe trait (like Send and Sync) for a variety of reasons:\n\nalloc can cause undefined behavior if the caller does not ensure that the layout\nargument has non-zero size.\nThat allocated block of memory may or may not be initialized.\ndealloc will cause undefined behavior the caller does not ensure that\nthe ptr denotes a block of memory returned by alloc (allocated via this\nallocator) and that the memory layout is the same as that used to allocate\nthe block of memory we're freeing.\n\nIn writing this allocator one make sure that the addresses returned are properly aligned.\nA difference from C we see here is that Rust split the responsiblities of dynamic memory\nallocation such that the caller of alloc and dealloc must specify the the alignment.\nalloc puts the burden of responsiblity on the allocator to return an address in memory\nthat is properly aligned while dealloc puts the onus on the caller to keep track of the\nmemory layout that was previous used to allocate the address being free'd. Rust has more\nrestrictions on memory alignment than C does. The benefits of this are that all common\ncode are in the same location avoiding the same code being written for every allocator.\nThis goes well with Rust's power to abstract away details from the user and additionally\nallows the Rust compiler to perform some langauge-level optimizations without involving\nthe allocator.\nBack to memory alignment: we need to write two utility functions to aide us, align_up\nand align_down which will find the closest memory address upwards or downwards to\nthe nearest multiple of some power of two. The power of two thing is just a convention,\nbut a good one at that because it's how computers are built! Multiplication, division,\naddition, and subtraction, are all much easier to do (i.e: faster) than attempting to do\nso with non-binary powers.\nIn a few simple lines, including an assertion that the align argument is a power of two.\nThread Safety\nThere is already extensive literature on creating thread-safe memory allocators. The reason\nis because most allocators are global to the scope of a program and dealloc and alloc\nare certainly not reentrant functions, as they operate on a slab of shared data. What happens\nif two separate threads (which we don't support yet) calls alloc at the sime time? Could\nthey receive the same address? If so, how large would the allocated region be? Rust, as a\nlanguage, takes these questions of concurrency very seriously. It is difficult to write\nprograms in Rust that isn't thread-safe. For our part the instructor has simply wrapped the\nallocator in a Mutex ensuring thread-safety by mutual-exclusion.\n#[path = \"bump.rs\"]\nmod imp;\n\n/// Thread-safe (locking) wrapper around a particular memory allocator.\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct Allocator(Mutex&lt;Option&lt;imp::Allocator&gt;&gt;);\n\nNote here that the imp module is virtual and not actually backed by a file of the same\nname on the file-system but instead given a path to the allocator of our choosing. In this\nlab we're going to write two different kinds of allocators so having an ability to easily\nswitch between implementations is really convienent. Our first allocator is called a \"bump\nallocator\" and our second is a \"bin allocator\". We'll go into more detail as to how these\ntwo memory allocators work further along in the post.\nMapping Memory\nHere is the implementation of our generic memory allocator:\nimpl Allocator {\n    /// Returns an uninitialized `Allocator`.\n    ///\n    /// The allocator must be initialized by calling `initialize()` before the\n    /// first memory allocation. Failure to do will result in panics.\n    pub const fn uninitialized() -&gt; Self {\n        Allocator(Mutex::new(None))\n    }\n\n    /// Initializes the memory allocator.\n    ///\n    /// # Panics\n    ///\n    /// Panics if the system's memory map could not be retrieved.\n    pub fn initialize(&amp;self) {\n        let (start, end) = memory_map().expect(\"failed to find memory map\");\n        *self.0.lock() = Some(imp::Allocator::new(start, end));\n    }\n}\n\nThe initialize method constructs an instance of the internal imp::Allocator structure\nfor later allocations and deallocations. It in turn calls memory_map to find out the start and\nend point of a region the region memory that has been mapped by the Raspberry Pi's bootloader\non start. We can implement this using the Atags implementation of the previous post!\nSince the MEM ATAG gives us the amount of memory available in RAM, we can just take the\nstart address in the tag (likely 0x0000000) and then add the size to that number to get\nthe end address before returning them both as a tuple (start, end).\n// Holds the first address after the kernel's binary.\nextern \"C\" {\n    static _end: u8;\n}\n\nuse pi::atags::Atags;\n/// Returns the (start address, end address) of the available memory on this\n/// system if it can be determined. If it cannot, `None` is returned.\n///\n/// This function is expected to return `Some` under all normal cirumstances.\nfn memory_map() -&gt; Option&lt;(usize, usize)&gt; {\n    let binary_end = unsafe { (&amp;_end as *const u8) as u32 };\n\n    for atag in Atags::get() {\n        if let Some(mem) = atag.mem() {\n            return Some(\n                (binary_end as usize, (binary_end + mem.size) as usize)\n            );\n        }\n    }\n\n    None\n}\n\nIt's imporant to note that the MEM ATAG reports the amount of total system memory in RAM,\nhowever, and not the amount of actually free memory. Our instructor has helpfully defined\nfor us binary_end that holds the first address of memory after the kernel\nBump Allocator\nOur first allocator will be the dumbest of all allocators. Whose behavior is specfified as:\n\nInitialized with the pointer at the beginning of our heap space\nWhen we request to alloc n-bytes of memory, the current pointer is bumped forward\nn-bytes (plus some alignment) and the old value of the pointer is returned.\nWhen we dealloc an address, nothing actually happens.\n\nHere's a diagram from the assignment's page that depicts what happens to the current pointer\nafter a 1k byte allocation and a subsequent 512 byte allocation. Though alignment concerns\nare abset in the diagram.\n\nWe're tasked with implementing the new(), alloc(), and dealloc() methods of the\nbump::Allocator using our align_up and align_down utility functions to ensure\nproper alignment of the return address.\nThe instructor wrote a good number of tests to run our solution against, though this is one\nof those times where the Rust core API has changed considerably enough over the past year\nthat we have to make some changes to get them running. I'll document this process here for\nothers taking the class years after it was first created.\nThe first bug we run into is related to a missing module raw_vec that supposedly contains RawVec:\nerror[E0432]: unresolved import `core::alloc::raw_vec`\n  --&gt; src/allocator/tests.rs:63:22\n     |\n     63 |     use core::alloc::raw_vec::RawVec;\n        |                      ^^^^^^^ could not find `raw_vec` in `alloc`\n\nLooking for RawVec in the standard documentation yielded no results though checking out\nthe official Rust repo we see a RawVec implementation in liballoc with the #![doc(hidden)]\nattribute, which is why it doesn't appear in the doucmentation.\nUsing the Allocator\nRust 1.28 introduced a stable #[global_allocator] attribute that allows Rust programs to either\nset the allocator used to the system allocator as well as create new allocators which implment\nthe GlobalAlloc trait. This is very nice for us because this means that just by properly\nimplementing alloc and dealloc within our custom allocator, we'll be able to manage\nmemory without having to know exactly how much memory our kernel will need at runtime.\n1\nA region (or page, though we haven't implemented paging yet) of memory that's mapped\nto an anonymous file.

Rust is a language that prides it self on memory safety and\nhigh-level \"zero-cost\" abstractions. Though somtimes, to get things done, a programmer has to write\ncode which is inherently unsafe. This is especially true for those working closer to the\nmetal.\nEven looking at the Rust core library itself we see a variety of data structures, like Vec that,\nwhile they can be used by us with utmost safety, are themselves implemented using unsafe\ncode.\nWhile working though Stanford's CS140e course, to learn Rust and operating systems development,\nI've come across a good many use cases where, despite having to write a good amount of\nunsafe code to interface with the ARM processor and other peripherals on the Rasperry Pi, we\nfind ourselves leveraging Rust's type system to lift the unsafe code into safe and usable\nlibraries, enforcing those type-safe guarantees ourselves.\nToday we're met with the need to write a heap allocator from scratch so that we can leverage\ntypes like Vec, HashSet, &amp; Box in our small operating system kernel.. To accomplish this we\nneed to get the kernel to read a what is called an ATAG list that's created by the firmware\nbootloader and placed in RAM on start.\n        +-----------+\nbase -&gt; | ATAG_CORE |  |                       a CORE tag always starts the list\n        +-----------+  |\n        | ATAG_MEM  |  | increasing address    MEM tags describe the memory layout\n        +-----------+  |\n        | ATAG_CMD  |  |                       CMD tags are commands for the kernel\n        +-----------+  |\n        | ATAG_NONE |  |                       a NONE tag always terminates the list\n        +-----------+  v\n\nEach tag in the list contains some information about the specific system that the\nkernel is running atop of: memory layout, console info, &amp;c. All of this information is provided\nto the kernel by the bootloader without the kernel having any idea on how the setup was performed.\nWe'll access this information to then build our custom memory allocator, by building an Iterator\nover these ATAGs.\nWe start by representing a raw ATAG with a struct:\n#[repr(C)]\npub struct Atag {\n    pub dwords: u32,\n    pub tag: u32,\n    pub kind: Kind,\n}\n\nEach Kind of tag will contain differing types of information and yet exist in within the\nsame region of memory as another kind. Because of this, it's necessary we use a C-like union\nso that we can store different struct layouts in the same memory space. Just as in C, the\nunion will have the maximum size and alignment of any of it's fields.\n#[repr(c)]\npub union Kind {\n    pub core: Core,\n    pub mem: Mem,\n    pub cmd: Cmd,\n}\n\nWith each of the types Core, Mem, and Cmd describing, as structs, the kind of information\nthe tag contains. All's well, however the compiler cannot make guarantees that the end-user\nof this raw Atag will always read the correct type of a raw union. Thus, manipulating a raw Atag is\nmemory unsafe.\nBefore we start implementing our conversion from raw structures to the safe structures we still\nneed a way of determining the address of the ATAG following the one pointed to by self and\nreturn a reference to it.\nThe signature is:\nfn next(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;Atag&gt;\n\nWhere &amp;self is the current Atag reference. All ATAGs contain a field that gives it's\nsize in double words (32-bit words) and we can use this information to know at what\noffset from the pointer to self the next ATAG in the list lives.\nTo do all of these we'll need to do some fancier type casting to get to the raw pointer,\ncompute the offset to the next, before eventually casting that to a &amp;Atag.\nRaw pointers in Rust are described using the type *const T and *mut T, on our 32-bit\nARM processor our pointers have the shape T of u32. Since we cannot cast from a reference\ntype to a raw 32-bit pointer directly, we cast to a raw pointer to the Atag type and then to\na *const u32 like so:\nlet curr = self as *const Atag as *const u32\n\nBefore then calculating the offset to the next ATAG:\nlet next = curr.offset(self.dwords) as *const Atag\n\nAnd finally converting from *const T to &amp;T by dereferencing the pointer and grabbing\nit's reference, giving us:\nimpl Atag {\n    pub const NONE: u32 = 0x00000000;\n    pub const CORE: u32 = 0x54410001;\n    pub const MEM: u32 = 0x54410002;\n    ...\n\n    /// Returns the ATAG following `self`, if there is one.\n    pub fn next(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;Atag&gt; {\n        match self.tag {\n            Atag::NONE =&gt; None,\n            _ =&gt; {\n                let curr = self as *const Atag as *const u32;\n                let next: &amp;Atag = unsafe {\n                    &amp;*(curr.offset(self.dwords as isize) as *const Atag)\n                };\n                Some(next)\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n\n\nWe now have a way of traversing the ATAG list using some pattern matching on the\ntag value and some simple pointer arithemetic. This will later be used to create our\nsafe Iterator implementation.\nTo expose this raw union type safely, we can leverage the safer tagged-union, or enum, type\nwhich gives us the advatage of unions but with the added security of memory safety since\nthe enumeration will always keep track of whatever particular type it contains.\n#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]\npub enum Atag {\n    Core(raw::Core),\n    Mem(raw::Mem),\n    Cmd(&amp;'static str),\n    Unknown(u32),\n    None\n}\n\nWith our tagged-union type in place, how to do we go about converting our raw::Atag types\nto the safer enumerated version?\nRust provides us with a useful trait called From for dealing with concept of performing\ntype conversions (safely!) from some type T into whatever U type the trait is being\nimplemented for.\nSince each variant of the Atag enum is simply a wrapper around their raw untagged counterpart\nimplementing the From trait for each raw::Kind should be as simple as pattern matching on\nthe structure of each atag and it's associated Kind type before then wrapping it with the\nappropriate enum variant:\n/// Convert from raw::* types into Atag\nimpl&lt;'a&gt; From&lt;&amp;'a raw::Atag&gt; for Atag {\n    fn from(atag: &amp;raw::Atag) -&gt; Atag {\n        unsafe {\n            match (atag.tag, &amp;atag.kind) {\n                (raw::Atag::CORE, &amp;raw::Kind { core }) =&gt; Atag::Core(core),\n                (raw::Atag::MEM, &amp;raw::Kind { mem }) =&gt; Atag::Mem(mem),\n                ...\n                (raw::Atag::NONE, _) =&gt; Atag::None,\n                (id, _) =&gt; Atag::Unknown(id),\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThough special attention should be made when converting the struct:\npub struct Cmd {\n    /// The first byte of the command line string.\n    pub cmd: u8\n}\n\ninto the Cmd(&amp;'static str) variant our enum. Noting that the cmd is a single byte from\nthe start of the null-terminated C-style string we know that &amp;cmd is the start address of\nthat string and that before allocating the string it's size must be found by looping over it\nuntil we hit the null terminator \\0 before then casting the start address and found size\ninto a slice using slice::from_raw_parts() and then finally into a string using\nstr::from_utf8(). With a string represented like:\n 0x0fe  0x102 0x106  0x10a  0x10e  0x112\n.-----.------.------.------.------.------.\n| \"A\" |  \"B\" | \"C\"  |  \"D\" |  \"E\" | \"\\0\" |\n`-----'------'------'------'------'------'\n &amp;cmd\n\nWe want to increments four bytes at a time when we add to our pointer so, we ensure our\npointer is of size u8, as expected. Incrementing len until we hit a null-byte:\nmatch (atag.tag, &amp;atag.kind) {\n    ...\n\n    (raw::Atag::CMDLINE, &amp;raw::Kind { ref cmd }) =&gt; {\n        let ptr = cmd as *const raw::Cmd as *const u8;\n        let mut len = 0;\n\n        while !ptr.add(len).is_null() {\n            len += 1;\n        }\n\n        let cmd = slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, len);\n\n        Atag::Cmd(str::from_utf8_unchecked(cmd))\n    },\n\n    ...\n}\n\nWith all this unsafe business out of the way, we can now finish our ATAG Iterator trait\nrequiring no unsafe keyword!\nHere is the type we'll be implementing Iterator for:\n/// An iterator over the ATAGS on this system.\npub struct Atags {\n    ptr: &amp;'static raw::Atag,\n}\n\nThe ptr field is a raw::Atag that we've already implemented a next method for using\nunsafe code for pointer arithmetic. Trusting that ATAG list's layout is created as above\nby the bootloader, ending with a NONE tag, the next method on raw::Atag should return\nNone if the tag is null, and we can ensure that the iterator will stop at the end of the\nATAG list. With all this, let's finally put our iterator together as:\nimpl Iterator for Atags {\n    type Item = Atag;\n\n    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Atag&gt; {\n        if let Some(next) = self.ptr.next() {\n            let curr = self.ptr;\n            self.ptr = next;\n            Some(curr.into())\n        } else {\n            None\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nMaking sure we're updating the current pointer, to ensure our iterator moves forward.\nSince Debug has been derived for our Atag types, let's see what ATAGs have been\ninitialized by the bootloader by looping over our Atags iterator in kmain.rs:\n#[no_mangle]\npub unsafe extern \"C\" fn kmain() {\n    ...\n    for atag in Atags::get() {\n        // pretty-print\n        kprintln!(\"{:#?}\", atag);\n    }\n\n    loop { run_shell() }\n    ...\n}\n\nBooting up the Pi and sending the new kernel binary over UART, we see three ATAGs\nprinted to the screen:\nCore(\n    Core {\n        flags: 0,\n        page_size: 0,\n        root_dev: 0\n    }\n)\nMem(\n    Mem {\n        size: 994050048,\n        start: 0\n    }\n)\nCmd(\n    \"bcm2708_fb.fbwidth=656 bcm2708_fb.fbheight=416 bcm2708_fb.fbswap=1 dma.dmachans=0x7f35 bcm2709.boardrev=0xa02082 bcm2709.serial=0x91055cb9 bcm2709.uart_clock=48000000 smsc95xx.macaddr=B8:27:EB:05:5C:B9 vc_mem.mem_base=0x3ec00000 vc_mem.mem_size=0x40000000  console=ttyS0,115200 kgdboc=ttyS0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait\"\n)\n\nThe MEM tag reports nearly a GiB of memory, about .074219 GiB less than the Pi's purported\n1 GiB of RAM.
